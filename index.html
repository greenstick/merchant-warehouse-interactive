									The Processing Environment of the Business

									Location of card processing is just one of the factors in determining the fees applied<br>
									against the transaction. Card Issuers consider purchases that occur in physical stores<br>
									as less risky than those made online, over the phone, or even face-to-face in non-brick<br>
									and mortar environments. As a result, cards processed face-to-face in retail locations<br>

								<div  class="leadText blueText">
									The Merchant's Card Acceptance Method
								</div>
								<div class="s8info">
									The way card information is captured also plays a major role in the fees assessed to<br>
									each transaction. Retail locations that physically swipe cards through their processing<br>
									equipment are charged lower fees than those that type or "key in" the information. 
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="s8c2">
								<div class="leadText blueText">
									Security Information Sent Along with the Transaction
								</div>
								<div class="s8info">
									When the card information is collected, a merchant can collect additional data points to<br>
									help decrease the risk associated with the transaction. Collecting items such as the<br>
									cardholder’s address and/or zip code, also know as address verification (AVS), and sending<br>
									this information with the transaction can help assure the card issuer that the cardholder<br>
									is using the card, rather than a third party for a fraudulent purchase. By reducing the<br>
									risk of fraud, the merchant further reduces the fees charged on each transaction.

									The Card Brand and Type Accepted
								</div>
								<div class="s8info">
									As of October of 2012, more than 700 interchange rates existed among card brands and<br>
									transaction types. Each card has its own associated rates, which vary based on the<br>
									previously noted factors. The highest rates are often associated with Corporate and<br>
									rewards cards, as the card issuers leverage the higher fees on these cards to finance<br>
									the rewards and offers that the cardholders receive. The lowest rates are historically<br>
									associated with debit cards; they were lowered even further following the Senate’s 2010<br>
									Durbin Amendment, which allowed the Federal Reserve to cap transactions fees for large<br>
									institutions.
